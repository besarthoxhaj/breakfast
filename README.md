## Breakfast

Your morning dose of javascript.

## Run

To run the examples one of the last versions of node and g++ is needed. In order
to compile the c++ run `g++ <file>` and it will produced a compiled version you
can run with `./<file>.out`.

## Debug

If you want to debug or get a better grasp of what's happaning, I suggest to run
node in debug mode.

- visit `chrome://inspect`
- click `Open dedicated DevTools for Node`
- run your code with `node --inspect-brk [file]`
