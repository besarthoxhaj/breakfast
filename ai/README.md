## Predict exam score

Given how you split your hours of sleep and study determine your exam score. The
table below summarizes the data.

| Hours sleep, hours study | Score |
| ------------------------ | ----- |
| (3, 5)                   | 75    |
| (5, 1)                   | 82    |
| (10, 2)                  | 93    |
| (8, 3)                   | ?     |

This is a **supervised regression** problem.

```js
var input = [
  [3, 5],
  [5, 1],
  [10, 2]
];

var output = [

];
```
