### Challenge

Look at following graph. First, find a basic data structure to represent it, second find the longest path from to nodes.

## Challenge

```js
insertNode()
// should insert a node or vertex into the graph

insertEdge()
// should create a link between to vertices

findPathFromTo(A,B)
// returns a set of instructions to travers from A to B
```

### Edge list
